B-1 Function Inlining
---------------------
        In this program we  observe how the code of a function  is placed in the
        position of  its call if  doing so does not  increase the code  size too
        much.

        Source file : B-1.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -O2 -fdump-tree-all B-1.c
        View result : vi -O B-1.c.*.ssa B-1.c.*.einline 
        View result : vi -O B-1.c.*.ssa B-1.c.*.7 
        Clear dumps : rm -f B-1.c.* B-1.o

        Note: On some older versions of gcc the pass may be named "einline2".

        2   Is there any way to get rid of it?

Answers : 
	1. It can't be discarded, because it may be called from another translation 
	   unit. (A translation unit is the basic unit of compilation in C++. It consists 
	   of the contents of a single source file, plus the contents of any header files 
	   directly or indirectly included by it, minus those lines that were ignored using 
	   conditional preprocessing statements.)

	2. Add the static keyword to the function prototype to signify that its linkage is
  	   internal only.
