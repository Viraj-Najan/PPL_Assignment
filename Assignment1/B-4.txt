Program
-------
        int main()
        {
            int a, b, c;
            b = (a + c + b) * (c + a);
            return b;
        }
Questions
---------
        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?
        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?

Answers :

	1   In SSA pass (a + c) is computed twice but in FRE pass it is calculated 
	    only once even if order was different ,

	2   We can check if there have been further optimisations by checking
   	    B-4.c.*.optimized, which is the final file after optimisation. redundant 
	    assignments have been eliminated in that file .

	3.  If we don't return b nad instead return 0 , the above code will result in 
	    elimination as dead code because it doesn't affect program result .
